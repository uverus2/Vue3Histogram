* Ensure your histogram displays correctly with extremes, e.g. how does it handle very high frequencies of a single number, what about negative numbers?
* Use different colors for each bar in the histogram.
* Add a button to refetch/regenerate the data (the endpoint will return random numbers each time).
* On hovering over a bar in the histogram, change the color and show a label above the bar with the precise value.
* You may notice that the [random.org](http://random.org) URL takes query parameters that will change the numbers generated: include a form that will dynamically generate the URL to provide a different set of numbers (e.g. more numbers, min/max value).
