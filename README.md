### Objective

Build a histogram chart from a list of randomly-generated numbers with JavaScript and Vue.

### Brief

Retrieve a list of numbers from an [endpoint](https://www.random.org/integers/?num=200&min=1&max=10&col=1&base=10&format=plain&rnd=new), then plot a histogram showing the frequency of each number in the list. The histogram should have appropriately-numbered x and y axes.

In the example below, the list contained 24 ones, 17 twos, 30 threes, and so on.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **JavaScript** best practices
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
-   Completeness: Did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: Does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: Is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: Is the system adequately tested?

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
